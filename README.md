# OpenCloning Backend API

This API is part of a bigger application, before going further, please go to the [main project readme](https://github.com/manulera/OpenCloning), where you can find an introduction.

This python API is built with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and is for *in silico* cloning.

## Summary

Read [main project readme](https://github.com/manulera/OpenCloning) first.

This API provides a series of entry points. The API documentation can be accessed [here](https://OpenCloning.api.genestorian.org/docs). You can use the documentation page to try some request directly on the browser. Otherwise, the API is open for you to make requests from a python script or command line at: [https://opencloning.api.genestorian.org/](https://opencloning.api.genestorian.org/).

## Getting started

If you want to quickly set up a local instance of the frontend and backend of the application, check [getting started in 5 minutes](https://github.com/manulera/OpenCloning#timer_clock-getting-started-in-5-minutes) in the main repository.

### Running locally

You can install this as a python package:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate
# Install the package from github (will be in pypi at some point)
pip install opencloning
# Run the API (uvicorn should be installed in the virtual environment)
uvicorn opencloning.main:app
```

### Running locally if you want to contribute

For the management of the dependencies `poetry` is used, if you don't have it, visit https://python-poetry.org/.

In the project directory:

```bash
# This should install the dependencies and create a virtual environment
poetry install

# Install the pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Activate the virtual environment
poetry shell

```

The virtual environment is installed in the project folder. This is convenient if you are using an IDE for development. For settings of vscode see the folder `.vscode`.

Now you should be able to run the api by running:

```bash
# The --reload argument will reload the API if you make changes to the code
uvicorn opencloning.main:app --reload --reload-exclude='.venv'
```

Then you should be able to open the API docs at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs) to know that your API is working.

### Running locally with docker :whale:

If you want to serve the full site (backend and frontend) with docker, check [getting started in 5 minutes](https://github.com/manulera/OpenCloning#timer_clock-getting-started-in-5-minutes) in the main repository.

If you want to serve only the backend from a docker container, an image is available at [manulera/opencloningbackend](https://hub.docker.com/r/manulera/opencloningbackend). The image is built from the Dockerfile in the root of this repository and exposes the port 3000. To run it:

```bash
docker build -t manulera/opencloningbackend .
docker run -d --name backendcontainer -p 8000:8000 manulera/opencloningbackend

```

If you don't want to download the repository and build the image, you can fetch the latest image from dockerhub (same image that is used in [https://opencloning.api.genestorian.org/](https://opencloning.api.genestorian.org/))

```bash
docker pull manulera/opencloningbackend
docker run -d --name backendcontainer -p 8000:8000 manulera/opencloningbackend
```

The api will be running at `http://localhost:8000`, so you should be able to access the docs at [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs).

### Connecting to the frontend

If you want to receive requests from the [frontend](https://github.com/manulera/OpenCloning_frontend), or from another web application you may have to include the url of the frontend application in the CORS exceptions. By default, if you run the dev server with `uvicorn opencloning.main:app --reload --reload-exclude='.venv'`, the backend will accept requests coming from `http://localhost:3000`, which is the default address of the frontend dev server (ran with `yarn start`).

If you want to change the allowed origins, you can do so via env variables (comma-separated). e.g.:

```
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3001 uvicorn opencloning.main:app --reload --reload-exclude='.venv'
```

Similarly, the frontend should be configured to send requests to the backend address, [see here](https://github.com/manulera/OpenCloning_frontend#connecting-to-the-backend).

#### Serving the frontend from the backend

You may prefer to handle everything from a single server. You can do so by:
* Build the [frontend](https://github.com/manulera/OpenCloning_frontend) with `yarn build`.
* Copy the folder `build` from the frontend to the root directory of the backend, and rename it to `frontend`.
* Set the environment variable `SERVE_FRONTEND=1` when running the backend. By default this will remove all allowed origins, but you can still set them with `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.
* Set the value of `backendUrl` in `frontend/config.js` to `/`.
* Now, when you go to the root of the backend (e.g. `http://localhost:8000`), you should receive the frontend instead of the greeting page of the API.

You can see how this is done in this [docker image](https://github.com/manulera/OpenCloning/blob/master/Dockerfile) and [docker-compose file](https://github.com/manulera/OpenCloning/blob/master/docker-compose.yml).

## Contributing :hammer_and_wrench:

Check [contribution guidelines in the main repository](https://github.com/manulera/OpenCloning/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for general guidelines.

For more specific tasks:
* Creating a new type of source: follow the [new source issue template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/new-source.md). You can create an issue like that [here](https://github.com/manulera/OpenCloning_backend/issues/new?assignees=&labels=new-source&projects=&template=new-source.md&title=New+source%3A+%3Cname-of-source%3E).

## Running the tests locally

```
pytest -v -ks
```

## Notes

### Ping a particular library version from github:

```
poetry add git+https://github.com/BjornFJohansson/pydna#4fd760d075f77cceeb27969e017e04b42f6d0aa3
```

### Generating API stubs

For the frontend, it may be useful to produce stubs (I use them for writing the tests). See how this is implemented
by looking at the `RecordStubRoute` class in `api_config_utils.py`. To run the dev server and record stubs:

```bash
RECORD_STUBS=1 uvicorn opencloning.main:app --reload --reload-exclude='.venv'
```

This will record the stubs (requests and responses) in the `stubs` folder.
