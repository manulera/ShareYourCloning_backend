I think it also makes sense for homologous recombination, but the meaning of the parameter `limit` in the assembly would have a slightly different meaning. For instance, if the length of the blue homologue regions from the image would be 8 bp, and we would set `limit` to 8, the assembly yielding the result would be returned. However, neither of the homologous regions would overlap 8, but instead they would overlap `x` and `8-x`. See example below.\n"
